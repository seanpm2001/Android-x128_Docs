# Android x128 Docs

## Welcome

Welcome to the Android x128 documentation center. There isn't much to document here at the moment, as the base system has not yet gone 128 bit (as of 2022, Tuesday, December 13th) so general miscellaneous information from the [Android x64](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Android-x64/) and [Android x32](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Android-x32/) is available here for now. We recommend checking out those projects in the meantime.

* [:octocat: `Android x32 on GitHub`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Android-x32/)
* [:octocat: `Android x64 on GitHub`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/Android-x64/)

Additional links for if you want to only see documentation:
